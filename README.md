# Cocktail Bar Optimiser
Given a **list of cocktails** and their ingredients, a **list of ingredients** and their cost, and a **budget** for purchasing a set of ingredients, compute the optimal set of ingredients that fits within the budget and allows for making the greatest variety of cocktails. This is a variant of the [Knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).

## Simplification of the problem
The problem does not take into consideration the volume or amount of the ingredients.

The following ingredients have a cost that is considered to be negligeable and are therefore excluded from the list of ingredients of each cocktail:

- ice cubes
- salt
- mint leaves
- sugar
